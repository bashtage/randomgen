cdef class PCG32(BitGenerator):
    """
    PCG32(seed=None, inc=0, *, mode=None)

    Container for the PCG-32 pseudo-random number generator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seed : {None, int, SeedSequence}, optional
        Random seed initializing the pseudo-random number generator. Can be an
        integer in [0, 2**64], a SeedSequence instance or ``None`` (the
        default). If `seed` is ``None``, then ``PCG32`` will try to read data
        from ``/dev/urandom`` (or the Windows analog) if available. If
        unavailable, a 64-bit hash of the time and process ID is used.
    inc : {None, int}, optional
        The increment in the LCG. Can be an integer in [0, 2**64] or ``None``.
        The default is 0. If `inc` is ``None``, then it is initialized using
        entropy.
    mode : {None, "sequence", "legacy"}, optional
        The seeding mode to use. "legacy" uses the legacy
        SplitMix64-based initialization. "sequence" uses a SeedSequence
        to transforms the seed into an initial state.  None defaults to
        "sequence".

    Attributes
    ----------
    lock : threading.Lock
        Lock instance that is shared so that the same bit git generator can
        be used in multiple Generators without corrupting the state. Code that
        generates values from a bit generator should hold the bit generator's
        lock.
    seed_seq : {None, SeedSequence}
        The SeedSequence instance used to initialize the generator if mode is
        "sequence" or is seed is a SeedSequence. None if mode is "legacy".

    Notes
    -----
    PCG-32 is a 64-bit implementation of O'Neill's permuted congruential
    generator ([1]_, [2]_). PCG-32 has a period of :math:`2^{64}` and supports
    advancing an arbitrary number of steps.

    ``PCG32`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce
    doubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers. These are not
    directly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``
    or similar object that supports low-level access.

    Supports the method advance to advance the RNG an arbitrary number of
    steps. The state of the PCG-32 PRNG is represented by 2 64-bit unsigned
    integers.

    See ``PCG64`` for a similar implementation with a smaller period.

    **State and Seeding**

    The ``PCG32`` state vector consists of 2 unsigned 64-bit values.
    ``PCG32`` is seeded using a single 64-bit unsigned integer.

    **Parallel Features**

    ``PCG32`` can be used in parallel applications using ``advance``
    with a different value in  each instance to produce
    non-overlapping sequences.

    >>> from numpy.random import Generator
    >>> from randomgen import PCG32
    >>> rg = [Generator(PCG32(1234, i + 1)) for i in range(10)]
    >>> for i in range(10):
    ...     rg[i].bit_generator.advance(i * 2**32)

    **Compatibility Guarantee**

    ``PCG32`` makes a guarantee that a fixed seed and will always produce
    the same random integer stream.

        Notes

        Advancing a RNG updates the underlying RNG state as-if a given
        number of calls to the underlying RNG have been made. In general
        there is not a one-to-one relationship between the number output
        random values from a particular distribution and the number of
        draws from the core RNG. This occurs for two reasons:

        * The random values are simulated using a rejection-based method
          and so, on average, more than one value from the underlying
          RNG is required to generate an single draw.
        * The number of bits required to generate a simulated value
          differs from the number of bits generated by the underlying
          RNG. For example, two 16-bit integer values can be simulated
          from a single draw of a 32-bit RNG.

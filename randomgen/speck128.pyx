    SPECK128(seed=None, *, counter=None, key=None, rounds=34, mode=None)

    Container for the SPECK (128 x 256) pseudo-random number generator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seed : {None, int, SeedSequence}, optional
        Entropy initializing the pseudo-random number generator.
        Can be an integer in [0, 2**256), a SeedSequence instance or ``None``
        (the default). If `seed` is ``None``, then  data is read
        from ``/dev/urandom`` (or the Windows analog) if available. If
        unavailable, a hash of the time and process ID is used.
    counter : {None, int, array_like[uint64]}, optional
        Counter to use in the SPECK128 state. Can be either
        a Python int in [0, 2**128) or a 2-element uint64 array.
        If not provided, the counter is initialized at 0.
    key : {None, int, array_like[uint64]}, optional
        Key to use in the SPECK128 state. Unlike seed, which is run through
        another RNG before use, the value in key is directly set. Can be either
        a Python int in [0, 2**256) or a 4-element uint64 array.
        key and seed cannot both be used.
    rounds : {int}, optional
        Number of rounds of the SPECK algorithm to run. The default value 34
        is the official value used in encryption. Reduced-round variant
        *might* (untested) perform well statistically with improved performance.
    mode : {None, "sequence", "legacy"}, optional
        The seeding mode to use. "legacy" uses the legacy
        SplitMix64-based initialization. "sequence" uses a SeedSequence
        to transforms the seed into an initial state.  None defaults to
        "sequence".

    Attributes
    ----------
    lock : threading.Lock
        Lock instance that is shared so that the same bit git generator can
        be used in multiple Generators without corrupting the state. Code that
        generates values from a bit generator should hold the bit generator's
        lock.
    seed_seq : {None, SeedSequence}
        The SeedSequence instance used to initialize the generator if mode is
        "sequence" or is seed is a SeedSequence. None if mode is "legacy".

    Notes
    -----
    SPECK128 is a 64-bit PRNG that uses a counter-based design based on
    the SPECK-128 cryptographic function [1]_. Instances using different values
    of the key produce distinct sequences. ``SPECK128`` has a large period
    :math:`2^{129}` and supports arbitrary advancing and
    jumping the sequence in increments of :math:`2^{64}`. These features allow
    multiple non-overlapping sequences to be generated.

    ``SPECK128`` provides a capsule containing function pointers that produce
    doubles, and unsigned 32 and 64- bit integers. These are not
    directly consumable in Python and must be consumed by a ``Generator``
    or similar object that supports low-level access.

    See ``AESCounter``, ``Philox`` and ``ThreeFry`` for a related
    counter-based PRNG.

    **State and Seeding**

    The ``SPECK128`` state vector consists of a 12-element array of uint64 values
    that capture buffered draws from the distribution, a 34-element array of
    uint64s holding the round key, and an 12-element array of
    uint64 that holds the 128-bit counters (6 by 128 bits).
    The offset varies between 0 and 96 and shows the location in the buffer of
    the next 64 bits.

    ``SPECK128`` is seeded using either a single 256-bit unsigned integer
    or a vector of 4 64-bit unsigned integers. In either case, the seed is
    used as an input for a second random number generator,
    SplitMix64, and the output of this PRNG function is used as the initial
    state. Using a single 64-bit value for the seed can only initialize a small
    range of the possible initial state values.

    **Parallel Features**

    ``SPECK128`` can be used in parallel applications by calling the ``jump``
    method  to advances the state as-if :math:`2^{64}` random numbers have
    been generated. Alternatively, ``advance`` can be used to advance the
    counter for any positive step in [0, 2**128). When using ``jump``, all
    generators should be initialized with the same seed to ensure that the
    segments come from the same sequence.

    >>> from numpy.random import Generator
    >>> from randomgen import SPECK128
    >>> rg = [Generator(SPECK128(1234)) for _ in range(10)]
    # Advance each SPECK128 instances by i jumps
    >>> for i in range(10):
    ...     rg[i].bit_generator.jump(i)

    Alternatively, ``SPECK128`` can be used in parallel applications by using
    a sequence of distinct keys where each instance uses different key.

    >>> key = 2**93 + 2**65 + 2**33 + 2**17 + 2**9
    >>> rg = [Generator(SPECK128(key=key+i)) for i in range(10)]

    **Compatibility Guarantee**

    ``SPECK128`` makes a guarantee that a fixed seed and will always produce
    the same random integer stream.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.random import Generator
    >>> from randomgen import SPECK128
    >>> rg = Generator(SPECK128(1234))
    >>> rg.standard_normal()
    0.123  # random

        there is not a one-to-one relationship between the number output
        random values from a particular distribution and the number of
        draws from the core RNG. This occurs for two reasons:

        * The random values are simulated using a rejection-based method
          and so, on average, more than one value from the underlying
          RNG is required to generate an single draw.
        * The number of bits required to generate a simulated value
          differs from the number of bits generated by the underlying
          RNG. For example, two 16-bit integer values can be simulated
          from a single draw of a 32-bit RNG.
